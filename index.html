        Education is an important part in everyone’s life. It not only makes us
        more knowledgeable, but it can boost a country’s economy as well. A lack in
        education means that people are not informed about basic health, math,
        and literature. Due to the shortage of funding and materials in
        developing countries, many students do not receive adequate schooling.
        In these nations, education is not their priority because of the high
        costs to maintain it. Most parents in developing nations make their
        children go to work to earn money, thinking that school is a
        waste of time. However, these developing nations deserve to have the
        same education that first-world countries have.
