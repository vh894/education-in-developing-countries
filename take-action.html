        <p>
          One of the main reasons why students cannot attend school is because
          of its high costs, which most families cannot afford. Therefore,
          schools in these areas need funding, whether through government
          funding or funding through charity. You can help achieve this by
          advocating and signing petitions to pressure the government into
          funding education. You can also donate to charities that help fund
          these schools.

        Educate Adults on the Importance of Learning
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As the caretakers and guardians of students, parents impact a lot of
          the decisions that a student can make. It is vital, therefore, that
          parents are educated about the benefits of sending their children to
          school so that they can benefit from learning in school. You can help
          achieve this by sharing this information so that this issue can reach
          parents and by donating to charities who will help persuade these
          parents.

        Provide Students with Better Materials
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Due to the lack of adequate supplies, students are not able to learn
          the material properly and as such do not achieve an understanding of
          the content they are learning. They sometimes do not even have access
          to vital resources like textbooks or properly qualified teachers. As
          such, it is important for you to donate to charities to help these
          students acquire these resources in order to achieve a better
          understanding of the world around them.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Use Digital Learning</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Digital learning allows students to access a wide variety of learning
          material, some of which they may not be able to have physically. The
          Internet provides numerous resources for students to learn many
          different topics that they normally do not have available to them in
          school. It is important, therefore, for these students to have access
          to the Internet so that they can use these resources. You can help
          make this a reality for many students by donating to charities who
          will help bring Internet access to these students.

          Sharing information on social media and other platforms spreads
          information to people who may be unaware of the current events of the
          world. Such information, especially that which concerns injustices,
          can inspire people to take action against these issues. Therefore, you
          can help raise awareness about the importance of education by sharing
          this information on your social media, such as on Instagram, Twitter,
          Facebook, etc.
